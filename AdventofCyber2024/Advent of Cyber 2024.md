# Day 1

**New Things Learnt**

* About malicious PowerShell scripts and why it is not safe to open them in a windows environment.
* Today's challenge is about OPSEC(Operational Security) failure. The user failed to remain anonymous and his details were revealed.
* The page also includes a bunch of interesting examples and instances of OPSEC fails.
* The first question can be answered by simply running the command 
```bash
exitftool song.mp3
```
from your Attack Box

* After going thru the [link](https://github.com/Bloatware-WarevilleTHM/CryptoWallet-Search/issues/1) , by clicking on the username `MM-WarevilleTHM`, we can see that on his GitHub page, his most popular repo named `M.M` has his details in his README.md file. Here we get the answer to our second question, that is, his name is ***Mayor Malware***.

* On the same user profile, if we go thru his second repo, that is where the malicious script is present, and we see that this repo only has 1 commit, and that is our answer.

# Day 2

**New Things Learnt**

* About the SOC, which is a team of IT security professionals that basically monitors a company's network and systems to prevent malicious activity from taking place.
* Now, they analyze alerts to determine if they are **F**alse **P**ositives or  **T**rue **P**ositives.
* Contacting the administrator/user is one of the best ways to analyze if the alert is real or not.
